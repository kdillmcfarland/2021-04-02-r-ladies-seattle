## Learning objectives

- Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer
- Create a local Git repository
- Complete the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files
- Identify and use Git HEAD and commit numbers
- Compare various versions of tracked files
- Restore old versions of files
- Configure Git to ignore specific files

## Version control

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.

![Changes Are Saved Sequentially](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/play-changes.svg)

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document. 

![Different Versions Can be Saved](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/versions.svg)

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a [conflict][git-terms] - you can 
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![Multiple Versions Can be Merged](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/merge.svg)

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a [commit][git-terms], and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a [repository][git-terms].
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.

## Setup git

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

#### Name and email

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
~~~

Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's. 
For these lessons, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address
used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. 

#### Keeping your email private

If you are concerned about privacy, please review 
[GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy]. 
If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address 
for the `user.email` value, e.g. `username@users.noreply.github.com` replacing `username` 
with your GitHub one.

#### Line Endings

As with other keys, when you hit <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard,
your computer encodes this input as a character.
Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line.
(You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.)
Because Git uses these characters to compare files,
it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. 
Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue 
[in the Pro Git book](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf).

You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings
using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`.
The following settings are recommended:

On macOS and Linux:

~~~
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
~~~

And on Windows:

~~~
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
~~~

#### Text editor

You also need to set your preferred text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| Emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| Vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |
| VS Code                | `$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`   |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

#### Exiting Vim

Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving
your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.

#### Check setttings

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

~~~
$ git config --list
~~~

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

## Create repository

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.

We will continue with the story of Wolfman and Dracula who are investigating if it
is possible to send a planetary lander to Mars.

First, let's create a directory in `Desktop` folder for our work and then move into that directory:

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
~~~

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository][git-terms]
-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:


~~~
$ git init
~~~

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `planets` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~
$ ls
~~~

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

~~~
$ ls -a

.	..	.git
~~~

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, 
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.

## Track changes

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier. But remember, the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the editor you choose (it might not be `nano`). For a refresher on text editors, check out ["Which Editor?"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/) in [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
~~~

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~

Let's first verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

~~~
$ ls

mars.txt
~~~

`mars.txt` contains a single line, which we can see by running:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~

#### status

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.

#### add

We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
~~~

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt
~~~

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.

#### commit

To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"

[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
~~~

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit][git-terms]
(or [revision][git-terms] and its short identifier is `f22b25e`. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~

it tells us everything is up to date.

#### log

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the repository's history using `git log`:

~~~
$ git log

commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
~~~

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

#### Where Are My Changes?

If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
That's because Git saves information about files' history
in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
(and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).

#### modify-add-commit again

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).

#### diff

It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

~~~
$ git diff

diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
$ git status

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"

[master 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [changeset]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#changeset)
but not yet committed.

#### Staging Area

If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
`git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
(putting things in the staging area),
and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and
makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`,
Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`,
which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo!
However, it's almost always better to
explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to the group photo simile,
you might get an extra with incomplete makeup walking on
the stage for the picture because you used `-a`!)
Try to stage things manually,
or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more
than you would like!

![The Git Commit Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/git-committing.svg)

#### Committing Multiple Files

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot (e.g. commit). 
You can `add` each file individually or `add` all files in the repository including
new, modified, and deleted changes with

~~~
git add .
~~~

Then `commit` under one commit message as normal

[commit-messages]: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
[git-references]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References

## Move through history

#### HEAD

As we saw  previously, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`, adding yet another line.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
An ill-considered change
~~~

Now, let's see what we get.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt

diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
 The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
+An ill-considered change.
~~~

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  

#### Old versions

The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` 
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**-d*uh*]) 
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt

diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,4 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
+An ill-considered change
~~~

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.

Our first commit was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b` but typing that out would be a pain. 
So Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
~~~

#### Restore old versions

So we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to
`mars.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt

Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   mars.txt
~~~

Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
~~~

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![Git Checkout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/git-checkout.svg)

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![https://figshare.com/articles/How_Git_works_a_cartoon/1328266](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdillmcfarland/2021-04-02-r-ladies-seattle-online/gh-pages/fig/git_staging.svg)

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

## Ignore files

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis?
Let's create a a dummy file to ignore:

~~~
$ mkdir results
$ nano results/result.csv
$ cat results/result.csv
data,result
A,1
B,2
~~~

and see what Git says:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	result.csv
	results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

~~~
$ nano .gitignore
$ cat .gitignore

*.csv
results/
~~~

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

~~~
$ git status

On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

~~~
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Ignore data files and the results folder."
$ git status

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don't want to track:

~~~
$ git add results/result.csv

The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
~~~

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example,
`git add -f results/result.csv`.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

~~~
$ git status --ignored

On branch master
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        results/

nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~

## Review

- Setup git `git config --global`
- Create a repository `git init`
- Track changes `git add`
- Save changes `git commit -m`
- Check if your repository is up-to-date `git status`
- View your repository history `git log`
- Reference versions `HEAD`, `HEAD~1`, or commit ID
- Compare two versions `git diff`
- Revert to old versions `git checkout`
- Ignore files `.gitignore`
